Bond angle refers to the angle formed between two bonds around a central atom. Hybridization is the mixing of atomic orbitals to form new hybrid orbitals. A sigma bond is a covalent bond where the electron density is centered between two nuclei. Ionic compounds have properties such as high melting and boiling points, solubility in water, and the ability to conduct electricity when dissolved in water. Cations are positively charged ions, and anions are negatively charged ions. Bond energy is the energy required to break a chemical bond. The Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale where zero represents absolute zero, the lowest possible temperature."

To treat a flea infestation, it is recommended to avoid using salt in homes without continuous air conditioning, as well as to conduct two or three treatments spaced three weeks apart. It is also advised to use insecticides sparingly when treating for fleas."

However, since the height is not given, you can use the Pythagorean theorem to find it. \n\nStart by drawing a perpendicular line from one of the vertices to the base with length $14$ (let's call this base $b_1$). This forms a right triangle with legs of length $14$ and the height of the trapezoid. The hypotenuse of this triangle is the leg with length $16$. Use the Pythagorean theorem: $14^2 + h^2 = 16^2$. \n\nSolving for $h$, you get $h = \\sqrt{16^2 - 14^2} = \\sqrt{256 - 196} = \\sqrt{60} = 2\\sqrt{15}$. \n\nNow that you have the height, you can plug it into the formula for the area of the trapezoid: $A = \\frac{1}{2}(30 + 40)(2\\sqrt{15}) = \\frac{70}{2} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{15} = 70\\sqrt{15}$.\n\nTherefore, the area of the trapezoid is $70\\sqrt{15}$."

The main advantage of a multistage rocket is that it can discard empty fuel tanks and engines as it ascends, making it lighter and more efficient. In the 60s, multistage rockets were used in the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union to launch satellites and manned missions to space. Today, multistage rockets are still used for space exploration and satellite launches. The Space Race was a competition between the US and Soviet Union to achieve milestones in space exploration.

As the war progressed, more women began to take on these roles, and their contributions were crucial to the war effort.\n\nSociety in the UK changed as the image of women shifted from being primarily seen as homemakers to also being recognized as capable workers.

If the marginal revenue product is greater than the marginal cost, it is advantageous to hire more workers. However, if the marginal cost exceeds the marginal revenue product, it is not beneficial to hire more workers.
